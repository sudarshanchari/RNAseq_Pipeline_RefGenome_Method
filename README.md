RNAseq_Pipeline_Reference_Method
================================
This Repository contains scripts for analyzing pooled RNA-seq data via 
- mapping to a reference transcriptome or genome using TopHat2, STAR, HISAT2 and Salmon (bash scripts calling the relevant mappers)

- performing differential gene expression analysis of single stage and time-series RNA-seq data that also touches upon p-value combination for multiple time-points (R workflow using Bioconductor packages)

- custom plotting including base R,ggplot2 and pheatmap
